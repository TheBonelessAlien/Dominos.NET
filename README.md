NOTE: Set your consoles encoding to UTF8 for certain symbols such as Â® to render (if you're using this in the console, that is):
```cs
Console.OutputEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;
```
First, add these namespaces:
  ```cs
using DominosNET.Stores;
using DominosNET.Customer;
using DominosNET.Address;
using DominosNET.Order;
using DominosNET.Payment;
using DominosNET.Menu;
```
Construct a `Customer`and `Address` object.
```cs
Customer customer = new Customer("2024561111", "Joe", "Biden", "joebiden@yourmom.com");
Address address = new Address("1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW", "Washington", "DC", "20500", "us", ServiceType.Delivery);
```
Or, if you live in Canada:
```cs
Customer customer = new Customer("6139924793", "Justin", "Trudeau", "justintrudeau@yourmom.com");
Address address = new Address("Wellington Street", "Ottawa", "Ontario", "K1A0A9", "ca", ServiceType.Delivery);
```
Then, get the nearest store to the user that supports the given service type:
```cs
Store store = address.closest_Store();
```


```cs
Menu menu = store.GetMenu();
menu.search("Coke");

```
prints to the console something along the lines of:
```
20BCOKE    20oz Bottle CokeÂ®        $1.89
20BDCOKE   20oz Bottle Diet CokeÂ®   $1.89
D20BZRO    20oz Bottle Coke Zeroâ„¢   $1.89
2LDCOKE    2-Liter Diet CokeÂ®       $2.99
2LCOKE     2-Liter CokeÂ®            $2.99
```
Or, you can search coupons.
```cs
menu.SearchCoupons(" ");
```
(This would literally print all the coupons on the menu)
Create an order and add items to the order:
```cs
Order order = new Order(store, customer, address, "ca");
``` 
Or, for my American dudes:
```cs
Order order = new Order(store, customer, address, "us");
``` 
Add items to the order:
```cs
order.add_item(3, "2LDCOKE"); //adds 3 2 litre diet cokes
```
Or, remove items from the order:
```cs
order.remove_item(2, "2LDCOKE"); //removes 2 2 litre diet cokes, leaving you with 1 (simple math ðŸ˜Ž)
```
You can also do the same with coupons:
```cs
order.add_coupon(69420);
order.remove_coupon(69420);
```
Finally, when you are done, place your order!
There are two methods to do this, credit card or no credit card.
Lets go over the first one. To place an order with a credit card, construct a `PaymentObject` and use that.
Canada:
```cs
PaymentObject payment = new PaymentObject("Justin Trudeau", "0123", "4498584993849383", "420" "K1A0A9");
order.place(payment);
```
America:
```cs
PaymentObject payment = new PaymentObject("Joe Biden", "0123", "4498584993849383", "420" "20500");
order.place(payment);
```
Or, you could pay with, for example, cash.
```cs
order.place("Cash");
```
You could also pay with GiftCard, CreditCard, DoorDebit, DoorCredit (will throw an exception if the store doesnt support said type)
```cs
order.place("GiftCard");
```
Or, if you don't want to actually order something, use pay_with to test.
```cs
order.pay_with("Cash");
```
That's all, enjoy! Of course, more will be added in the future. I would like to see your creations with this!

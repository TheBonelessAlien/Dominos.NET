NOTE: Set your consoles encoding to UTF8 for certain symbols to render:
```cs
Console.Encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
```
First, add these namespaces:
  ```cs
using DominosNET.Stores;
using DominosNET.Customer;
using DominosNET.Address;
using DominosNET.Order;
```
Construct a `Customer`and `Address` object.
```cs
Customer customer = new Customer("2024561111", "Joe", "Biden", "joebiden@yourmom.com");
Address address = new Address("1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW", "Washington", "DC", "20500", "us", ServiceType.Delivery);
```
Or, if you live in Canada:
```cs
Customer customer = new Customer("6139924793", "Justin", "Trudeau", "justintrudeau@yourmom.com");
Address address = new Address("Wellington Street", "Ottawa", "Ontario", "K1A0A9", "ca", ServiceType.Delivery);
```
Then, get the nearest store to the user that supports the given service type:
```cs
Store store = address.closest_Store();
```


```cs
Menu menu = store.GetMenu();
menu.search("Coke");

```
prints to the console something along the lines of:
```
500COKE  500ml CokeÂ®  $2.49                                                                                             2LCOKE  2 Litre CokeÂ®  $3.99                                                                                            12CCOKE  355 ml CokeÂ® Can  $1.49                                                                                        500DIETC  500ml Diet CokeÂ®  2.49                                                                                        2LDCOKE  2 Litre Diet CokeÂ®  $3.99                                                                                      12CDCOKE  355 ml Diet CokeÂ® Can  $1.49                                                                                  310COKENRG  Coca-Cola Energy, 310mL can  $3.49      
```
Create an order and add items to the order (this adds a 12 inch hand tossed pepperoni feast pizza and a 500mL Diet Coke to the order):
```cs
Order order = new Order(store, customer, address, "ca");
``` 
Or, for my American dudes:
```cs
Order order = new Order(store, customer, address, "us");
``` 
Add items to the order:
```cs
order.add_item(3, "500DIETC"); //adds 3 500ml diet cokes
```
Or, remove items from the order:
```cs
order.remove_item(2, "500DIETC"); //removes 2 500ml diet cokes, leaving you with 1 (simple math ðŸ˜Ž)
``
Finally, when you are done, place your order!
There are two methods to do this, credit card or no credit card.
Lets go over the first one. To place an order with a credit card, construct a `PaymentObject` and use that.
Canada:
```cs
PaymentObject payment = new PaymentObject("Justin Trudeau", "0123", "4498584993849383", "420" "K1A0A9");
order.place(payment);
```
America:
```cs
PaymentObject payment = new PaymentObject("Joe Biden", "0123", "4498584993849383", "420" "20500");
order.place(payment);
```
Or, you could pay with, for example, cash.
```cs
order.place("Cash");
```
You could also pay with GiftCard, CreditCard, DoorDebit, DoorCredit (will throw an exception if the store doesnt support said type)
```cs
order.place("GiftCard");
```
That's all, enjoy! Of course, more will be added in the future. I would like to see your creations with this!
